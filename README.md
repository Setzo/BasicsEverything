Hello, 

In this repository I'm storing everything I might consider useful in the future.
Basically everything here was a test program written by me to learn the syntax of java.
Only the C++ folder(which i just need for uni) and Mastermind.pas file isnt java,
it is an old program I wrote, the first big one.
I decided to keep it due to its sentimental value.

BTW, Don't mind the c++ folder, it's only for the things I have to do for my uni.

Peace.
